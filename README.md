Title: Making a Unity game
Summary: This will be my first live stream so I will rely on your real-time feedback (via chat) to make any adjustments needed to the video or audio. I will be showing you how to create a project in Unity3D, and then create a game from scratch. We will try to cover the following:
Importing 3D character asset
Character movement
Spawning and moving collectibles
Spawning and moving hazards
Unity GUI
Health system
Scoring system (including high-score)
Persisting high-scores (e.g. restarting game keeps previous high score data).
Animation control

Beware: I won't be demonstrating best practice. The focus of the video is getting from A to B as quickly as possible, so we can have something to play with.

Every tool and asset I use will be available for free, and the source code will be uploaded/linked to GitHub afterwards.
